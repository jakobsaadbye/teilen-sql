// @TODO: Change getChangesForCommits to return Change[] instead of Change[][]!

Fix column values of sqlite text type to be misinterpreted as integer columns when checking out a differrent commit
  Hint: The problem is probably in 'fastApplyChanges' wherein the 'value' column has an ANY type, so strings column that look
        like an integer, e.g 60eafc... gets interpreted as numbers, leading to bogus values. We probably need to also store the type of
        column in "crr_columns" to know how to interpret them ...
